In game Khun SW4014 bale wrapper edited to wrap faster. Also added the option to wrap the largest square and round bales (s240&r180). 

Changes in the XML file is marked either with #NEW or #EDITED for you to easier be able to change the mod to your preference. 

Note! When wrapping the largest round bales it looks a bit glitchy, but it works.
