In-game Khun SW4014 bale wrapper has been edited to wrap faster. Additionally, the option to wrap the largest square (s240) and round (r180) bales has been added. The price has been adjusted to 40K, as the default in-game version seemed a bit expensive. Feel free to adjust the price to your preference if you disagree.

Changes in the XML file are marked with either #NEW or #EDITED to make it easier for you to customize the mod according to your needs. The total time from pickup to dropping a bale is approximately 7 seconds, compared to the default in-game wrapper's approximately 17 seconds.

Note: When wrapping the largest round bales, there may be minor visual glitches, but the functionality works as intended.

Installation Instructions:
