In game Khun SW4014 bale wrapper edited to wrap faster. Also added the option to wrap the largest square and round bales (s240&r180). Price adjusted to 40K, thought the in game one was a bit on the expensive side. Feel free to adjust this yourself if you dissagree.

Changes in the XML file is marked either with #NEW or #EDITED for you to easier be able to change the mod to your preference. 
On download the total time from pickup to dropped bale is about 7 seconds, the default ingame wrapper is about 17 seconds from pickup to dropped bale. 

Note! When wrapping the largest round bales it looks a bit glitchy, but it works.

For installation download the .zip file and insert it in your mod folder. Do NOT unzip!
The individual files are not needed to install the mod, just in the repositiory for vizualisation.
