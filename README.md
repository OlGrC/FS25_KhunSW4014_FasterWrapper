In game Khun SW4014 bale wrapper edited to wrap faster. Also added the option to wrap the largest square and round bales (s240&r180). Price adjusted to 40K, thought the in game one was a bit on the expensive side. Feel free to adjust this yourself if you dissagree.

Changes in the XML file is marked either with #NEW or #EDITED for you to easier be able to change the mod to your preference. 

Note! When wrapping the largest round bales it looks a bit glitchy, but it works.

For installation download the .zip file and insert it in your mod folder. Do NOT unzip!
